# This is DaCoolOne's code compressing code (before the addition of GUI), that was itself compressed, and renamed as to reflect this madness properly
# Victima - Input (doesn't compress 1-9 lines)
# Daemonium - Output
# Insanus Rituali - compressed code compressor
# Why did i do that? Because i could!
